I'm thinking of buying a ukelule. Seems like it's probably the easiest actual instrument to play. I have a basic knowledge of music (I've written a couple "progressive house" songs), but I'm not that good at any of it. I decided that I have so much downtime that I should learn a lot of little party-tricks and skills just to help round myself out a bit; full life and all that jazz.

My plan is to learn a very basic Irish dance, learn a little coding (C, C++ maybe), figure out how to play a uke, get a very basic game going in the Godot engine (I should also play around in the CryEngine a bit), and learn to say one phrase ("of course his hands are wet, he's standing under a waterfall.") in at least a few languages. Other than that, I'm going to use this fall to build a little nest-egg and fill out my transcript. (Note to self, go through book lists checking off all the ones you've read. Can't put them on the transcript unless you can remember which ones you've read."

In Linux news, I've been playing The Witcher 2 (AoK, EE) which is probably the most fun game I've played since Skyrim. I'm just so disappointed that Witcher 3 hasn't had any progress made on a Linux version.
Besides that, I'm going to try to reinstall MX Linux and this time install the Mint driver manager, because I think that's where most of my issues were coming from. I'd stick with Mint, but 1. I like fringe distros (they just apeal to me) and 2. Mint just takes so long to start up. I'm pretty sure I could make it boot faster if I really tried, but I already know all the tricks for doing it with MX and I don't want to take the time to learn how to do it with Mint (TLDR: I'm lazy)

And that's all my rambling for today. Maybe someday I'll get comments, but right now I'm looking for a non jaba-script based comment.... thingy.
