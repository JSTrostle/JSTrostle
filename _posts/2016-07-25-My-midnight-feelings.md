Don't worry, it's not as stupid and sappy as the title makes it out to be; it's mainly just me rambling on about what I learned today.

What are my thoughts? Hmmm... Well I'm still not impressed with the Skyrim re-release (on a relevant note, I learned "nonplussed" doesn't mean "not excited", but it actually means "confused". (What's really cool is that this is my blag, so I can digress as much as I want. Neat!)), it just seems to me to be much ado about nothing. SKSE is required to run most of the cooler mods, and with mods presumably becoming bigger and more complex now that the RAM isn't capped by a 32bit executable anymore, most of the best mods won't even make it to can'tsole (har har!).

What else? I read an article about porting games to Linux. Kind of a tangent, but I think I worked out a way to port a lot more games to Linux:

1. Make a game
2. Have a group of devs sign an NDA and have them remove all third-party/middle ware
3. Have a second group of devs fill-in/ black-box reverse-engineer the now missing code
4. Release the "scrubbed" source code. The community can port it from there

Of course this is entirely unnecessary if game companies would just not use middleware and not cross-platform engines, but since I don't really see them giving that up for quite a few years, I'm hoping this would be an effective work-around.

Anyway, I'm going to sign off on this first actual post. Tomorrow I'll look at getting this hooked up so Google sees it. After that I might see if I can get comments hooked up (So I can meet Mr. and Mrs. Spambot), and then I might see abut changing the domain name, linking it to my other profiles, etc,.
