I think I'll start with the Linux news today: Tim Sweeney of Epic Games thinks that Microsoft will try to slowly strangle Steam to death. I'm not a fan of Steam (DRM) but, and I hate to admit it, Steam is head-and-shoulders above Microsoft when it comes to ethics, so I'd much rather have them come out on top of this whole deal. It makes sense for Microsoft though: "We're fazing out the old win32 apps in favor of the more robust and secure Windows 10 app store apps. Many of your old win32 apps can be upgraded to a Windows 10 app store app for no charge; so that you can keep your software for FREE! (not all apps are eligible for upgrade)". Then it would be a simple matter of putting Steam on the un-upgradeable list.
I really hate how if push comes to shove I'm in Steam's corner. I find its policies icky, but I find Microsoft's deplorable. I'm inbetween a rock and a hard place and I'm helping the rock. Oh well, could be worse.

Moving on from Tech news, I don't really have anything else going on but I feel the need to just keep writing my thoughts down. I'd really like to go see The Book of Mormon and Alexander Hamilton (the plays, not the historical figures). I've never been a big fan of Hamilton ("let's have a national debt! That will help!"), but I probably haven't done my dues about his history, so I shouldn't be one to judge. 

That wraps up another blog post. Besides tech and personal news, I might add in some football learning stuff. I wonder if in the future people will required to read this blog series. I don't mean in a self aggrandized way, but as a way to see into the head of a random millennial. Then again they have Facebook for that. Oh well, it's nice to dream.
