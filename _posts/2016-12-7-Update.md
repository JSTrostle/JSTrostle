Ah. It's been a while.

Anyway, I overhauled the entire theme for the blag and tried changing up a few things; we'll see how it goes. It's not finished yet, (I'd like to figure out a way to plug the developers and reorganize the links) but it's a work in progress. I also got accepted to college (Vassar) so now I have to get ready to go to New York. The financial package is not here yet, it comes on the 15th, but the preliminary things say I shouldn't have very many student loans at all. If I'm lucky (and good), I should be able to get a full college education without having to go horrible into debt. Woo!
